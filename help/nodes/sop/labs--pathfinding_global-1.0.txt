"""This node creates paths between points of interest on a given terrain based on cost and avoidance attributes."""

This node takes points and their connections as input as well as a corresponding terrain, and generates the paths between them based on cost and avoidance attributes from the input terrain.


@parameters

    == Pathfinding ==

    === Point Cloud ===

    Source:
        #id: source
        The source of the point cloud that is going to be used for the generation of the paths.

        __Existing Grid Points__:
            Uses the points derived from the terrain mesh combined with the primitive centroid points.

        __Scattered Points__:
            Scatters points in the terrain mesh.
            
    === Scattered Points ===

    Generate:
        #id: generatepoints
        The method of generating the points to scatter to the surface of the terrain mesh.

        __Total Count__:
            Generates an exact number of points to scatter to the surface of the terrain mesh.

        __By Density__:
            Generates the number of points to scatter to the surface of the terrain mesh based on a density value.

            
    Number of Points:
        #id: numberofpoints
        The exact number of points to scatter to the surface of the terrain mesh.
        
    Density:
        #id: density
        Value indicating the density of points to generate.
        
    Relax Iterations:
        #id: relaxiterations
        The iteration by which the points are pushed away from eah other.
        
    === Noise ===

    Noise Amplitude:
        #id: noiseamplitude
        Introduces noise to the position of the points to break the uniformity and sharp corners of the paths that are going to form.

    === Path Cost Calculation ===
    
    End Points:
    #id: endpoints
    The name of the end points attribute.

    Attribute Name:
        #id: attributename#
        The name of the attribute to use as cost for the pathfinding
        
    Attribute Weight:
        #id: attributeweight#
        The weight of the attribute that contributes to the cost.
        
    === Avoidance ===

    Enable Avoidance:
        #id: enableavoidance
        Use of avoidance to the pathfinding.
        
    Avoidance:
        #id: avoidanceattribute
        The name of the avoidance attribute.
        
    == Output Attributes ==

    Output Distance:
        #id: outputdistance
        Output the distance attribute.
        
    Distance:
        #id: distancename
        The name of the distance attribute.
        
    == Visualization ==

    Visualize Settlements:
        #id: visualizesettlements
        Visualize the settlements as guide geometry.
        
    Settlements Size:
        #id: settlementsize
        The size of the sphere that represents the settlement.
        
    Settlements Color:
        #id: settlementcolor
        The color of the settlements.
        
    Visualize Point Cloud:
        #id: visualizepointcloud
        Visualize the point cloud as guide geometry.
        
    Point Cloud Color:
        #id: pointcloudcolor
        The color of the point cloud.
        
    Visualize Terrain:
        #id: visualizeterrain
        Visualize the terrain mesh as guide geometry.
        
    Terrain Color:
        #id: terraincolor
        The color of the terrain guide.
