"""This node generates connections between points of interest based on angle and distance calculations."""

This node takes points as input and generates connections between them based on the angles that are formed and the distances between them.


@parameters

    == Connection Filters ==

    Avoid Small Angles between Connections:
        #id: enableangle
        The connections are filtered based on angle and distance comparisons between the points of interest.
        
    == Filter by Angles ==

    Angle Limit Mode:
        #id: anglemode
        The algorithm checks the angle and distance between every point of interest and a target point, and the point of interest to the neighboring check points.

        __Uniform Angle Limit__:
            When the point of interest to target point distance is bigger than the point of interest to check point distance, and the angle between them is smaller than the __Angle Limit__, then the connection between the point of interest and the target point is marked for deletion.

        __Varied Angle Limit Based on Distance__:
            When the point of interest to target point distance is bigger than the point of interest to check point distance, and the angle between them is smaller than the one that is derived from the aforementioned ramp, then the connection between the point of interest and the target point is marked for deletion.
        
        The ramp has the minimum __Reference Distance__ as the lower position limit with a value of the minimum __Angle Limit__ and the maximum __Reference Distance__ as the higher position limit with a value of the maximum __Angle Limit__. The angle limit is derived from the point that has the target point distance as the position index inside the range of the ramp.
            
    Angle Limit:
        #id: uniformangle
        The limit of the angle between the points of interest. When the angle that is formed is less than this value, the connection is marked for deletion.

    === Shorter-Distance Connections ===

    Reference Distance:
        #id: mindistance
        The lower position limit which has the value of the minimum __Angle Limit__ on the __Varied Angle Limit__ ramp.
        
    Angle Limit:
        #id: minangle
        The value of the shorter __Reference Distance__ on the __Varied Angle Limit__ ramp.
        
    === Longer-Distance Connections ===

    Reference Distance:
        #id: maxdistance
        The higher position limit which has the value of the maximum __Angle Limit__ on the __Varied Angle Limit__ ramp.
        
    Angle Limit:
        #id: maxangle
        The value of the longer __Reference Distance__ on the __Varied Angle Limit__ ramp.

    == Output Attributes ==

    End Points:
    #id: endpoints
    The name of the end points attribute.

    Output Distance:
        #id: outputdistance
        Output the distance attribute.
        
    Distance:
        #id: distancename
        The name of the distance attribute.
