= Labs Biome Adjust Settings (Beta) =

"""An interface to change underlying biome parameters and related settings of the Labs Biome system."""


The biome settings displayed are saved in an external JSON file, and this interface allows editing of the different biome properties. To change the JSON file being referenced or to create a new file, the file path must be changed in the LabsBiomes package.
